            <p>English Version:<br />
 It's such a concidence that today is the LAST Teachers' Day I</p>
<p>spent before I leave this country. Although I'm quite busy these days,</p>
<p>luckily, I arranged some EXTREMELY meaningful activities today.(LOL)<br />
 1.I paid a visit to Mrs. Lin, my class teacher who taught me</p>
<p>Chinese during the last year of my elementry school.(I made up for my</p>
<p>having not paying visits[完了，召唤英语达人，帮我解决这个肯定存在的语法</p>
<p>问题！！！] to her during the past 7 years.)<br />
 2.I went back to the PuXI Road Elementry School and took photos</p>
<p>there.<br />
 3.I walked around in the GuangQI Park with my family and sat by</p>
<p> the English Corner for a while, which, brought back many memories.</p>
<p>(Alpha, we meet there for the first time years ago, remember ?)</p>
<p> Mrs. Lin,my former class teacher, who lent a helpy hand to me</p>
<p>when I was in a critical situaion and arose my confidence during my</p>
<p>forth year in elementry school. (Probably known to all)And in the</p>
<p>picture in my album, you can also see her mother, also teaches Chinese,</p>
<p>who gave me classes before I went to WFL. Talking about the classmates</p>
<p>in WFL, they all went on their own way now, they went to places all</p>
<p>around world, just as the school anthem sings.......&quot;Tomorrow we go all</p>
<p>around the world..&quot;（世外的别骂我啊，继续召唤高人翻译校歌！！！那么多英</p>
<p>语强人，都站出来啊！Arise !!! My Champion!!I am summoning you!!）<br />
 Sigh......isn't it interesting? We were singing OUR future</p>
<p>again and again years ago without even thinking about it! (Maybe</p>
<p>someone thought about it...whatever) In short, I just hope all the</p>
<p>WFLers live well, study well and be happy no matter where they are.<br />
 <br />
 And there is something about my elementry school, which doesn't</p>
<p>even exsit any more. Seen from the album, there is a school gate, which</p>
<p> belonged to PuXi Road Elementry School 10 years ago. The former campus</p>
<p>of that school now belongs to a technical school called DONGHENFU.</p>
<p>(Awesome school indeed) . The former hall for our PE lesson has now</p>
<p>become the entrance hall of the DHF technical School.  In the classroom</p>
<p>which I sat in years ago sits some hooligan-like boys and</p>
<p>girls.Disappointed, I took a few pictures and went away.</p>
<p> Finally, the GuangQI Park, where I often exersice my oral</p>
<p>English when I was a little boy. Some 10 years ago, I walked on the</p>
<p>huge tomb of Xu Guang Qi and practiced my Oral English there.(haha, my</p>
<p>English is stiiiiiiiiiillllllll so bad....AS you can see) I met Alpha,</p>
<p>who called himself &quot;Bank&quot; at that time( ROFL ),without even knowing</p>
<p>some 10 years later, he and I will take adventures together in a MMORPG</p>
<p> called World Of Warcraft./hehe!! Standing beside the tomb, I tried to</p>
<p>concentrate and listend as if I could hear the the self-introduction I</p>
<p>made here ten years ago : I'm Frank, I'm ten, I like playing computer</p>
<p>games. Yepp, that sound echos far in the Cave of Time. My way of going</p>
<p>aborad starts here.So,I climbed on that huge tomb again and prayed</p>
<p>silently for a while. Mr. Xu will bless me in that tomb!!</p>
<p> I am leaving Shanghai next Monday. What I thought brings me the</p>
<p>scene in the book called <The Solitaire Mystery>.<br />
 The silver brigantine sank in the billowy ocean. A sailor float</p>
<p>to an island which is becoming larger and larger.<br />
 <br />
 The Solitaire Game is a kind of family cursing. There is always</p>
<p>a joker who see through the whole game. Generation after generation,</p>
<p>the joker who won't be devistated by the time lingers around the world</p>
<p>eternally. And one who sees through the fate is to endure the torture</p>
<p>of the fate inevitably.</p>
<p>-----------------------------------</p>
<p>Why I wrote this English version ? It's simple , cuz some of my friends</p>
<p> isn't quite familiar with Chinese.</p>
<p>写的不好，有错误请一定指出</p>
