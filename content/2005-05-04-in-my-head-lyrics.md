It's the cruelist joke to play,  
I'm so high I run in place.  
Only a line we separate,  
so................  
  
Chorus:  
Keep on playin' our favorite song,  
turn it up, while you're gone.  
It's all I got when you're in my head,  
and you're in my head, so I need it.  
  
You're the only thing I got,  
that I can't seem to get enough.  
We collide for one embrace,  
so..............  
  
(Chorus)  
  
(Instrumental break)  
  
  
Oh...........oh.  
  
Oh, my radio,I can't wait forever........  
  
(Chorus X2)  
  
I need it....  
I need it....  
I need it now
