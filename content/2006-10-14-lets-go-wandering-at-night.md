I'm with an American these days cuz we share some interests. Most people gather alone with their friends and have fun at night in APU. Sometimes they go to somebody's room and drink, sometimes they play cards in the LOBBY, and sometimes, they play computer game together.

I, however, wanted to know more people and make friends with them, and that American, who call himself Win, also have the same idea.

One day, he asked me whether I'd like a wandering in the AP House in order to meet more different people. And I agreed. So, we went wandering in the corridors in the dorm.

First we met a couple of girls from Thai. At that time, Win made a mistake that he thought those Thai girls are Japanese based who speaks few English. So, he started to communicate in Japanese, which was not very good. After 10 minutes, he discovered that he was wrong...... That was so funny....

最近我都和一个叫Win的美国人在一块。因为我们有不少相同的兴趣，其中一个就是在house到处闲逛。虽然我们都和一堆欧美的家伙们认识，不过我并不想一直和他们在一起。这样我们到这个学校来的目的就丧失了。所以，既然要认识更多的人。我们就开始到处闲逛。

我们一般从5楼开始，一直走啊走，走到1楼。看似无聊，不过路上可以遇到不少人，于是，我们就可以抓住两个不认识的人聊一会儿。不知不觉就会认识很多人。

发现口语提高了很多很多，但是.....貌似我的writting....开始出问题了......完结完结.....

暂且就这样
