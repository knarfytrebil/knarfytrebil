Only 12 Days left before I leave for Japan, with lots of things to do still. First I need to have my suit case packed, necessities bought, and I have to see lords of people before leaving such as my grandparents, teachers, friends...etc...  One thing is to mention that Ellen(if u still call him Ellen is leaving for U.S.A. in October, in that case, I am not the last one who leaves now. (^o^Y)  But still, I have to meet him once.

The second thing to say here is that I regret that I didn't study programming well in highschool. The most ironic thing is that when I went to a computer company runned by a friend of my father's, I saw various people programming with Visual Basic 6.0 and MS Access database, which was what I was supposed to learn in highschool!! And these people who graduate from Shanghai TV (Understand?) University earns about 500 grand(that's USD) a month...

I am trying to use Linux these days.....  I don't trust Microsoft any more cuz MS is making PC users even more ignorant. I am sick of of user friendly User Interface now. So, maybe linux will save me.....
