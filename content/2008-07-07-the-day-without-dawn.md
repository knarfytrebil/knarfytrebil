We are fighting for our right to live, to exist . . .and should we win the day , the day when the world declare in one voice we will not go quietly into the night. . . we will not vanish without a fight. . . were going to live on, were are going to survive!

Buckle up pirates, Gentle Man, Let's prown the road !!
