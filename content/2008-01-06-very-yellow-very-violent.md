At the beginning of 2008, a line has become very popular on the Chinese Online Community, which is '很黄很暴力', meaning 'Very エロい Very 暴力'. The famous line itself is originated in a TV interview of the CCTV (Chinese Central Television Station). The interview was about the sexual and violence content online in China, and its huge impact on little kids who are now studying primary school and middle schools.  
  
Every one knows that it's very hard to stop the sexual contents or violence contents online, for they are extremely hard to be identified by simple programs, and also, monitoring them by man power cost a lot of time and money too. In Japan, people sees Sexual Advertising all the time on the internet and already accepted it gradually as a normal phenomena, (YEAH, I KNOW YOU GUYS WATCH SEXUAL THINGS IN YOUR EARLY YEARS.)  
  
But the point is, the CCTV conducted an interview with a 1 year middle-school student in Beijing and asked her how did she saw those 'Unhealthy' contents. And she simply said ' Last time when I was looking for information on the internet, all of a sudden, a website pumped out and it was really sexual and violent (很黄很暴力).  
  
NOBODY WOULD EVER BELIEVE THIS, This is ridiculous, how could you come up with some website bumping out both ' SEXUAL' and 'VIOLENCE' at the same time when you are looking for some information for your studying ???????? Does google have s bumping out advertising ? Does WIKIPEDIA have bumping-out advertisment ?? None of them has. WHAT A PITY AND WHAT THE F\*\*K !  
  
The television station is making up a false impression to people who are watching it that here are countless 'unhealthy' contents on the internet and people can not even help not coming up with it, which discourage parents to buy computers and or subscribe to internet service in some young Chinese family. But the news and the interview itself is really as ridiculous and hilarious as a bad excuse of those who was caught one seen watching sexual contents.  
  
So, I consider what is mentioned above as, MEDIA VIOLENCE. The media is putting what they want you to know and how they want your way of thought to be shaped on the screen and most of the ignorant people would be fooled with PROPAGANDA, which is kinda sad.  
  
So, people who realize the fact that they are being raped by propaganda decided to revenge in their own way. Since it was a former interview, the middle school girl's name was written on the screen, which was quite common in China. With that singe hint and also Beijing, where the girl was interviewed, hundreds and thousands of people started looking for any information avaliable about that girl. And with the hard work of hundreds of people, they got what they wanted.  
  
So, the girl's family address, school, and her position in the class was exposed online. Her personal photo graphs, where her parents works and telephone number was also exposed. Everyday, lots of people make telephone calls to the girl to ask her where she found those contents which doesn't exists.....  
  
Basically, her life is simply ruined by her helping the CCTV creating a false image of the internet. Her life is ruined by the so called 'INTERNET VIOLENCE', which is one of the most scary factors in the Chinese internet community.  
  
Isn't it ironic ? People have to take revenge of 'Media Violence' with 'Internet Violence' ? Have they ever thought about how the girl's life would become and it's huge impact on her life in the future. ....  
  
No one knows. And from another point of view, this story is just fantastic, for it's really a fight-back on the mighty CCTV in some sense.
