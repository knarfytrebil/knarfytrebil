#### Universal Tagging vs Pre-Set Categories

There is a problem recent years on **“Categorizing”** items within applications, that is, whether to use Universal Tagging or Pre-Set Categories. Though I think the answer is quite clear, many, aren’t.

I still remember since the release of Gmail, google never used any “hard-coded” categories in it. Instead, they used tags. Yes, it’s very easy, basically you can tag everything, and you can create new tags. Items of different kind can be tagged, so that their relationship can be easily determined by a program. Also, from the angle of designing patterns, it is also recommended to use tags instead of categories. Why ? Because it iterates faster. With one set of code, program will be able to sort, filter, query, and order item lists within seconds. Moreover, tags, as objects can be created on the fly, which gave both users and programmers immense freedom on searching and managing objects.

#### The Interface

However, there is always a problem: how do we align the user interface with such convenient functionalities ? There wasn’t a problem on desktop applications, for there is always a screen that is big enough for users to choose with. On desktop applications, there is usually a “Tag List” for users to choose from. Still, take Gmail for example, the tag list resides on the left side of the screen, where user can manage very easily. Same thing can be seen on Twitter and Instagram, where tags become hash tags, enabling users to search posts much more efficiently.

So there is no reason to use categories any more, right ?

Sadly the answer is NO and it’s quite solid. Look at the interface of WordPress itself, actually categories and tags Co-Exists. Confusing, isn’t it ? But there is quite a good reason for that: users need to put their blog posts into “big” categories, tags are only for searching. Though, tags can also be used to categories, however, any blogs with a certain tag will be included into a category page, which is not what the user wants. Instead, the user wants something like a drawer in their “Mind Palace”, so that they can put things inside.

And thus, came the ultimate problem. The Wardrobe, it is quite clear that the wardrobe need both categories and tags, with a limitation on mobile screen sizes.

Though, we believe in the near future human beings will eventually abandon the use of small screens. We have to implement both Category and Tags upon creating our wardrobe items.

How to squeeze the complicated interface into the tiny screen, remains a problem.
