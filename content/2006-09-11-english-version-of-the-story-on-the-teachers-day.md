English Version:  
 It's such a concidence that today is the LAST Teachers' Day I

spent before I leave this country. Although I'm quite busy these days,

luckily, I arranged some EXTREMELY meaningful activities today.(LOL)  
 1.I paid a visit to Mrs. Lin, my class teacher who taught me

Chinese during the last year of my elementry school.(I made up for my

having not paying visits\[完了，召唤英语达人，帮我解决这个肯定存在的语法

问题！！！\] to her during the past 7 years.)  
 2.I went back to the PuXI Road Elementry School and took photos

there.  
 3.I walked around in the GuangQI Park with my family and sat by

 the English Corner for a while, which, brought back many memories.

(Alpha, we meet there for the first time years ago, remember ?)

 Mrs. Lin,my former class teacher, who lent a helpy hand to me

when I was in a critical situaion and arose my confidence during my

forth year in elementry school. (Probably known to all)And in the

picture in my album, you can also see her mother, also teaches Chinese,

who gave me classes before I went to WFL. Talking about the classmates

in WFL, they all went on their own way now, they went to places all

around world, just as the school anthem sings......."Tomorrow we go all

around the world.."（世外的别骂我啊，继续召唤高人翻译校歌！！！那么多英

语强人，都站出来啊！Arise !!! My Champion!!I am summoning you!!）  
 Sigh......isn't it interesting? We were singing OUR future

again and again years ago without even thinking about it! (Maybe

someone thought about it...whatever) In short, I just hope all the

WFLers live well, study well and be happy no matter where they are.  
   
 And there is something about my elementry school, which doesn't

even exsit any more. Seen from the album, there is a school gate, which

 belonged to PuXi Road Elementry School 10 years ago. The former campus

of that school now belongs to a technical school called DONGHENFU.

(Awesome school indeed) . The former hall for our PE lesson has now

become the entrance hall of the DHF technical School.  In the classroom

which I sat in years ago sits some hooligan-like boys and

girls.Disappointed, I took a few pictures and went away.

 Finally, the GuangQI Park, where I often exersice my oral

English when I was a little boy. Some 10 years ago, I walked on the

huge tomb of Xu Guang Qi and practiced my Oral English there.(haha, my

English is stiiiiiiiiiillllllll so bad....AS you can see) I met Alpha,

who called himself "Bank" at that time( ROFL ),without even knowing

some 10 years later, he and I will take adventures together in a MMORPG

 called World Of Warcraft./hehe!! Standing beside the tomb, I tried to

concentrate and listend as if I could hear the the self-introduction I

made here ten years ago : I'm Frank, I'm ten, I like playing computer

games. Yepp, that sound echos far in the Cave of Time. My way of going

aborad starts here.So,I climbed on that huge tomb again and prayed

silently for a while. Mr. Xu will bless me in that tomb!!

 I am leaving Shanghai next Monday. What I thought brings me the

scene in the book called <The Solitaire Mystery>.  
 The silver brigantine sank in the billowy ocean. A sailor float

to an island which is becoming larger and larger.  
   
 The Solitaire Game is a kind of family cursing. There is always

a joker who see through the whole game. Generation after generation,

the joker who won't be devistated by the time lingers around the world

eternally. And one who sees through the fate is to endure the torture

of the fate inevitably.

\-----------------------------------

Why I wrote this English version ? It's simple , cuz some of my friends

 isn't quite familiar with Chinese.
