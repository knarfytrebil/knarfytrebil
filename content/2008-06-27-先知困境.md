有人大约知道大概会发生什么，

他很高兴

可惜，正因为他知道了将要发生什么这件事本身改变了未来。

因此，原本该发生的事情没有发生。  

很讽刺，非常非常的讽刺！

看透命运的人必将承受命运的折磨。

Destiny is a snake which is so hungry it devours itself.

The inner box unpacks the outer box at the same time as the outer box unpackes the inner.

Desiny is a cauliflower head which grows equally in all directions.

  
The solitaire is a family curse. There is always Joker to see through the delusion.  
  
Generation succeeds generation, but here is a fool walking the earth who is never ravaged by time.  
  
The one who sees through destiny must also live through it.

天机不可泄漏！
