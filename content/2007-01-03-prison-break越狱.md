I have been alway using a metaphor that my room in AP House is like a prison cell, which is kind of true for it's small and lonely. If you stay in the room for more than 48 hours for just reading and chatting on the internet, you will feel like hell.  
  
I have been feeling like dead as a rotten zombie these days cuz neither does the foreigners or the Chinese I know stays here any longer. They've been traveling through out this weird country. And for me, what I enjoyed most is, ironically speaking, watching an American TV series called prison break. As Michel Scofield is figuring out and struggling his way out side Fox River, the prison in which his brother and him stuck, I am figuring out how to get out of this nasty little room by myself. And finally, I got some clue today.  
  
Talked to a Mongolian these days constantly, I find out that not only me is felling lonely and boring, and there are a lot of others too, like him. I have to admit this mountain, this school makes people feel inhuman and sometimes really awesome. Staying in the room, sitting, starring at a computer doesn't seem to be the best solution for loneliness. But what I have to say is that it's better than playing cards or simply billiards out side in the lobby.  
  
I know that we Chinese can easily accomplish something like playing billiards or table tennis cuz we are the third majority here in APU. But don't you ever feel boring by doing this ?! Don't you think it's a totally waste of time spending hours playing cards with a bunch of people you have already known and practicing Chinese ?! BUT THE PROBLEM CAME : WHAT ELSE WE CAN DO ?!  
  
Hopelessly the answer is almost to none. But still, I got the answer. Go back to your room what every in the lobby happened, cuz that's none of your business here. No matter how lonely you are, don't go to the lobby. Staying in the room and read something is the best solution, cuz you gain something there. But you lose a lot in the lobby.  
  
The lobby was a better place for me when the Euros and Americans were once there. Practicing English is always a good thing to you rather than practicing Chinese.  
  
I bought A Japanese Version for Harry Potter and A book about ghost for Children.  
  
OK, I hope I enjoy all this, which , although, looks like crap.
