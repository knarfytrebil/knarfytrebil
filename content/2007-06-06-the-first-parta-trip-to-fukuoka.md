A two-days trip in Fukuoka

  

In the last two days of June the 4th and the 5th in 2007, I stayed in Fukuoka and traveled around the famous tourist sites in and around the city thoroughly, and also did lots of shopping for some gift for people, groceries and something special I really wanted.

One thing forgot to mention is that I had CY i.e. Yang Jing Yuan (杨进源) accompanied all the time, and thanks him very much for the money he lent me and carrying my bag when needed, being the tourist guide sometimes.

We set off for Fukuoka on 5:45 in the morning of June the 4th, when it was really smoky or foggy on the APU mountain, with our back packs packed earlier in the previous night. The bags are not so heavy but we all brought our computers, which enables me to write this small article right on my way back to APU to Fukuoka.

Woken op on the bus, I realized that I have already arrived somewhere in Fukuoka, where I totally have no idea of. Getting my back pack, I walked out of the station, realizing that I am on the 4th floor of a department store downtown Fukuoka, totally surprised to discover that the but station is right 4 stories above the ground, which is quite unbelievable. I have been to some major cities in the world, but I never seen this kind of bus station right in a department store on the fourth floor before. Guided by CY, we got some money and went to the subway station downtown, encountering just float consisted by Japanese people who are hurrying to work in the morning. The human wave is just the same in Shanghai and other big cities in the world, but the only one amazing thing is that in this very Japanese subway station, you can’t hear anyone talking except the foot steps . It’s quiet as hell. Every Japanese at presence is on a stiff face, looking so serious, some of which looks very anxious about their works, some even looked worried. This very scene shows how Japanese people are involved in their work. They are worrying about it everyday even when they go to work.

There are lots of pretty or some could even be called beautiful girls in the subway in Fukuoka as well as in Shanghai. One thing about girls I discovered in Japan is that the girls looked most good looking when they are in high school, well there also might be a difference on taste between me and Japanese guys though. But the Japanese high school girls are amazingly pretty. Well, the are big eye-candies for me.

A Temple of which the name I forgot

We then visited a temple which is unfortunately under maintaining. The difference between Japanese Temples and Chinese ones are that
