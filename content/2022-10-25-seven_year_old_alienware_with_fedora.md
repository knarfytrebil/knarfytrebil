# Seven Year Old Alienware with Fedora

## Some history with the Alienware laptop

I have been using this Alienware 13 R2 for almost 7 years since 2015. It was (and still) a very powerful machine that ran Windows 7, I don't do much of developing work, but rather prefered playing games on it. "Fallout 4" was the popular game then. The Alienware runs without any issue. I've taken this laptop with myself to Japan, and over the years, it wears out. I have replaced the ssd, the battery and so it's still running after seven years.

## Fedora, DWM & Alacritty 

At the moment, after moving out of Japan. I decided to use the Alienware laptop more like a desktop, hooking up 2 32-inch monitors to it. Since I'm no longer needing to play games on it (World of Warcraft runs more smoother on my Macbook Pro with a Radeon Graphics Card), I installed Fedora as my daily runner.

I ditched GNOME because it is huge and consumes lots of memories, I used dmw from [suckless.org](https://suckless.org) and it seems that I there are some more configuration todo:

- DWM Status Bar
  - WIFI
  - Battery
  - Current Time
- Power Management
  - Automatic hibernation when docked
  - Dual Screen Monitor detection
  - Lid Open / Close detection
- Login Manager
  - Light Weight Login Manager

Hope I can finish doing this in the next few days.
