            <p>写这类文章要以客观的口吻，太散文的不适合申请写作。</p>
<p>比如：自己的特征和个性</p>
<p>先列提纲：1. thoughtful 2. persistent 3. good at computing 4. good language competence</p>
<p>然后对这几点扩充。</p>
<p>恐怕你需要全面改写</p>
<p>                                   Application Form for the WASEDA University</p>
<p>       I am a man of nearly 18 years old and I do think the most important thing for me at this age is to make a good plan for my whole life. Going to the WASEDA University, which has always been my dream, is obviously one of the best ideas. The following statements explains why I think the WASEDA University suits me.</p>
<p>                                                          My Characters</p>
<p>       First of all, I am a thoughtful person. Thoughtfulness is a glittering character for a person in this competitive society. A thoughtful person is actually creating different new ideas all the time. Although some of the ideas might be proved useless or stupid, efficient and constructive thoughts will always appear as long as one keeps on thinking. I am such a thinker, though sometimes not sharp enough, who often think about various problems. So thoughtfulness makes me unique and different from others for I always have my own opinion towards all kinds of things. From a rather different angle or various different angles, I look upon things in a far more sophisticated way and I can often have an insight into all kinds of things. Frankly speaking, I have been training myself to be a man of deep insight for a couple of years, and I know I haven’t achieved my final goal yet. All I need is some more practical experience.</p>
<p>       Secondly, I am a creative person. Creativity is perhaps one of the most valued characters of our time. Creativity is power. Creativity enables me to create a variety of different things such as songs, pictures, computer programs and so on. Through creating my own things, I can experience the happiness and passion. And I often get more experienced after I have created something. So my creativity has provided me with confidence and passion on almost everything.</p>
<p>       Thirdly, I am also a persistent person. Persistence is always the key to success. Persistence give a person some kind of a weak and everlasting power that enables him to keep on doing his job, no matter how hard it will be. Sometimes, the biggest obstacle on our way to success is our losing the will to go on. I am a persistent person, and I have enough initiative to face any difficulty. Even if it is myself.</p>
<p>                   The reason why I want to go to WASEDA University</p>
<p>What am I going to do in the future? What problem am I going to face or solve in the coming years? Why is the world being like this and by what way can we change the world for the better? When will there be peace all over the world? And what can we do to prevent conflicts between one and another? There are lots of questions like that unsolved as those mentioned above. I have been thinking of these questions for years and can’t find a single satisfying answer. So, I have to find an ideal place to discus these problems, which have been bothering me, with people who have the same problems disturbing them. By discussing and learning, my horizon will be expanded, my knowledge will be enlarged, my thought will be deepened, my ability will be strengthened. And where can I find a place to challenge my ability, cultivate my ability of solving problems and learn to communicate with people around the world? WASEDA University is undoubtedly the best choice.</p>
<p>                                  Something about me</p>
<p>       My name is YaoYuan and my nick name is Frank. I am an energetic man and I love everything about computer technology. I have been taking part in various programming competitions and have won several prizes in computer programming. I can program in several different programming languages such as Javascript, Basic, Actionscript, and C++. And I know a few about Assembly language, which is the basis of any other programming languages. I think the information technology is the most promising field in the world.</p>
<p>I am also good at English, which enables me to communicate with people all over the world more freely. I also have won several prizes in English. I can speak rather fluent English. I have made friends with people from various countries such as Poland, Britain, Germany, Ghana and so on and I have been keeping in touch with them all the time.</p>
<p>My favorite sports is swimming. I think swimming is a best way of exercising. I can also do some meditation while swimming.</p>
<p>I also traveling, I have been to many places in China and visited a variety of tourist sites. I have been traveling abroad to Australia in 2003 for 14 days. I have learned a lot from traveling. I won’t be feeling shy when talking in English to foreigners. I even helped a Singapore officer at Changi airport to measure someone’s body temperature.</p>
<p>The strongest point of me is that I love thinking. I think that only by thinking can some problems be solved finally. And keep on thinking is a good habit, which lets a person to create new thoughts in every second. Thinking provides you with an insight in almost everything, which also makes you unique. When I meet with trouble, when I failed to do something, when I get nervous, I will sit down and start thinking. And soon will I be confident and cool again. It’s obvious that the best way to evaluate a person is to see whether he likes thinking.</p>
<p>                                 My Plans</p>
<p>                                   Before enrollment</p>
<p>If I am luckily enrolled into the WASEDA University, I will have about 4 months free from school. I will have to do lots of things in 4 months.</p>
<p>First and the most important thing I have to do is to learn some basic Japanese because I will have to live in a Japanese environment in the next 4 years. A good sense of Japanese is the key to success. Learning a second language will also make me competitive in job hunting after my graduation. What I am going to do is not only to practice my written Japanese and also my oral Japanese. I will practice my oral Japanese on the internet with all kinds of Japanese in order to speak more fluent Japanese.</p>
<p>Secondly, I will have to meet various friends in Shanghai to say good bye. Then I will do various preparations for studying in Japan. I will buy a map and get familiar with the city of Tokyo.</p>
<p>                                          After Enrollment</p>
<p>To be continued in 2 days…….</p>
<p>                                                 After Graduation</p>
<p>To be continued in 2 days…….</p>
