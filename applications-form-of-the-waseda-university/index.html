            <p>Applications Form of the WASEDA University</p>
<p>I am nearly 18 years old and I think the most important thing for me is to make a good plan for my life. Going to the WASEDA University, which has always been my dream, is obviously one of the best plans. The following statements may explain why I think the WASEDA University suits me best.</p>
<p>                                  My Characters</p>
<p>First of all, I am a creative person. Creativity is perhaps one of the most valued characters of our time. Creativity is power. Creativity enables me to create a variety of different things. I take pictures, compose music and design computer programs. Through creating, my mind gets sharper, my thoughts become unique. And I can always be confident to face any challenge.</p>
<p>Secondly, I am a persistent person. Persistence is always the key to success. Persistence gives a person some kind of weak but everlasting power that keeps him doing his job no matter how hard it will be. Sometimes the biggest obstacle on our way to success is not all kinds of difficulties but our losing initiative. It seems that a persistent person will never lose his courage and initiative. I think I am a person of this kind.</p>
<p>       Thirdly, I’m a thoughtful person. Thoughtfulness is a glittering character for a person in this competitive society. A thoughtful person is actually creating different new ideas all the time. Although some of the ideas might be proved useless or stupid, efficient and constructive thoughts will always appear as long as one keeps on thinking. I’m such a thinker; though sometimes not sharp enough, who often think about various problems. So, thoughtfulness makes me unique, different and even outstanding from others for I always have my own opinion towards all kinds of things. From a rather different angle or various different angles, I look upon things in a far more sophisticated way and I can often have an insight into all kinds of things. Frankly speaking, I have been training myself to be a man of deep insight for a couple of years. Yet, I know I haven’t achieved my final goal. All I need is some practical experience.</p>
<p>                             What I am Quite Expert In</p>
<p>First, I want to say that I loved all kinds of things about computer technology. From animation making to visual arts, electronic music composing to programming, CPU/GPU over clocking to assembling a PC. And actually, I love DIYing. I often modify the firmware of my electronic dictionary and mobile phone by programming in assembly language to gain better functions or just to make them unique. Besides, I know quite a lot about internet security for I had my own website once and I gained quite a few practical experiences from running it. I often help my classmates and friends when they come up with some problem on computer. Though I am not quite interested in taking part in competitions, I have won several awards in the competition held by the government for my programming and animation making skills. I am really proud to get such awards. It gives me confidence and courage though I am not really interested in competitions. I think that computer technology is not learned for winning awards but for daily use.</p>
<p>Second, I have a good language competence. In fact, I am interested in learning languages. And this also means that I learn a language much faster than others. I might take great advantage of this character for I will improve both my Japanese and English quickly during my studying in WASEDA University. I can often improve my language skills outside the classroom by applying a variety of different ways. I used to improve my English skills by oral chatting with native speakers on the internet. By chatting, I become general when I talk to foreign instead of being shy. I cultivated good habits and a natural manner on talking. Through chatting, I also made friends with all kinds of people of all sorts of nationality. I gained many precious experiences from it. And finally I achieve a TOEFL score of 620. So, I think it would be easy for me to pick up Japanese. And it is obvious that whether I speak good Japanese or English is vital to my study or even survival in Japan.</p>
<p>                                My Plans</p>
<p>                                 Before Enrollment</p>
<p> There will be almost 5 months before my enrollment if I will be luckily enrolled by the WASEDA University. There will lots of things waiting me to do in these 5 months.</p>
<p>One of the most important things is perhaps practicing my language skills. That’s because one of the most though difficulty I am about to face would be communicating with others in a completely unfamiliar nation.</p>
<p>Secondly, I am going to read something more about the culture background of Japan. Because this will make it easier for me to adapt the Japanese society. I have to be familiar with their values and their opinions to the whole world. This will help me know more about the Japanese customs and the best ways to get alone with Japanese people. And also, I should keep on practicing my written and oral English. English will be always useful in all over the world, I have to practice it hard because there might be all sorts of situations in which it is needed especially incase I can’t express myself by Japanese.</p>
<p>I will have those things done in 4 months. And this will absolutely benefit my further study in Japan.</p>
<p>                            After Enrollment</p>
<p>After this September, if I will be enrolled into the WASEDA University, I will work hard in studying and socialize with other students there. My dream is to open a computer software company, which devotes itself in to game developing. In my opinion, outstanding computer games should be innovative, interactive, with high graphic quality, entertaining and the most important is to be educational. And I do think that most computer games on the market are far below the standard. It’s so obvious that there are many world famous video game companies in Japan. And that’s one of the reasons why I want to go to Japan. And still in my first year in the university, I’d better practice my Japanese well. And also, I have to learn all the courses provided by the WASEDA University, for those background knowledge in many different subjects will widen my imagination and view. Besides what have been mentioned above, I have to learn some more about computer programming, software developing all sorts of things related to that.</p>
<p>In brief, I will have to keep on practicing Japanese, learning the courses provided by the school and something about computer on my own, and socialize with as many other students as possible.</p>
<p>                                                 After Graduation</p>
<p>I plan to stay in Japan for a master or doctor degree. Or I will go to a European or American university for a doctor degree.</p>
<p>I think that what occupation will we pick up has been decided since we are 7 or 8 years old. And I think that it is because the call from the innermost that keeps us working hard and pursuing the goal. I think that the end of my university life will mean a lot to me for that’s a signal indicating the beginning of the life on my own.</p>
